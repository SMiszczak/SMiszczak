## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Szymon

Welcome to my personal GitHub account, where I plan to showcase my skills and projects. Currently, due to my work commitments, I donâ€™t have as much time as Iâ€™d like for personal projects. However, let me tell you a bit about myself! :) 
So, firstly let me tell you some of my knowlendge:
* GitHub is a powerful, multi-platform tool that helps organizations, regardless of their size, manage projects effectively. By adding a project to GitHub, teams can manage, track, publish, and discuss changes in real-time. I have extensive experience managing multiple projects with Git and am well-versed in GitHubâ€™s functionalities. While Iâ€™m aware of other version control options, GitHub is currently the platform Iâ€™m most comfortable with.
* Iâ€™m skilled in repository management, commit structuring, and version control best practices, including branches and merge strategies. I understand how to create clear, meaningful commits, when to start new branches, and how to handle common challenges, such as conflict resolution during merges. I also know how to undo mistakes through rollbacks and work efficiently with large repositories. For me, well-organized, clearly named commits are essentialâ€”theyâ€™re my top rule for producing quality code.
* Backend and frontend developerâ€”in other words, a full-stack developer. I have experience working on multiple projects in various languages and technologies, with a primary focus on backend development. However, Iâ€™m also skilled in planning, implementing, and building fast, reliable frontends from scratch. Oh, and I should mentionâ€”my main area of expertise is in web technologies.
* I also have experience in building new systems from scratch, which has been one of the most challenging aspects of my work so far. Iâ€™ve successfully created entire services, including frontend and backend development, documentation, and user guides. But thatâ€™s not allâ€”I was responsible for planning the entire system, designing the UI, and organizing and leading client meetings to present the system and incorporate client feedback.
The most rewarding part was implementing changes and presenting my ideas to clients, often successfully gaining their support for my concepts. I approach my work with passion, and Iâ€™m proud that most of my ideas for functionality and UI were enthusiastically received by clients. ðŸ˜Š
After that large self advertising part it's time for something important, so this is list of languages, technologies, programs, librarys and functions that i use:
* C# â€“ This is the language Iâ€™m most familiar with, primarily for backend development. I work with various versions of C# and .NET, as some projects are older and others are new. Although updating older projects to the latest versions would be ideal, differences in functions and libraries across versions can create unexpected bugs, so updates arenâ€™t always feasible. I am experienced with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and use it to connect to existing databases, often via the console. I focus on clean, well-structured code, applying design patterns, SOLID principles, and best practices. While I strive to produce error-free code, Iâ€™m always learning from the occasional mistake. Iâ€™m also familiar with .NET MAUI and eager to expand my knowledge in this area to work on innovative future projects. My approach to coding emphasizes robustnessâ€”my goal isnâ€™t just to create code that works and looks good, but to anticipate potential errors by thoughtfully implementing exception handling. My work often includes try-catch blocks to ensure the security and durability of applications, essential priorities in my company. On the topic of secure C# programming, one key practice I follow is null-checking to prevent potential null reference errors. I also work with async functions, parallel programming (when it adds clear value), and server-side tasks. For instance, I initiate tasks on the backend and send a response to the frontend confirming that the task has started, allowing the frontend to check the status without making users wait unnecessarily.
* PHP â€“ Iâ€™m familiar with PHP and use it as needed, though I havenâ€™t yet created any projects from scratch, so my experience is at a basic level.
* JavaScript â€“ Iâ€™m comfortable working with JavaScript both with and without frameworks. I have strong experience with Vue.js and Vuetify, allowing me to create websites from scratch, add custom functionality, and manage complex forms with interconnected fields. Iâ€™m skilled in handling reactivity, signals, and event handling, making sites interactive and responsive. Vue.js, in particular, is intuitive and offers great potential for building beautiful websites. JavaScriptâ€™s flexibility also provides powerful options for creating unique scripts.
* Rust â€“ I love Rustâ€™s approach to memory management and safety. I have experience using Rust for simple desktop and web applications and have worked with AJAX and Leptos. Rustâ€™s approach to safety aligns with my coding principles.
Here are a few additional skills:
* Web Programming Patterns â€“ In addition to the languages and technologies mentioned, Iâ€™m also familiar with React, cookie management (saving, decrypting, and deleting data in C# and Rust), and the difference between client-side and server-side code. I understand server-side rendering patterns and can work with middleware; I can even create middleware from scratch in Rust. I know how to handle chunked data transmission to ensure data integrity.
* Docker â€“ I frequently use Docker to build services and create simple scripts for automation. Although I rely on references for basic commands like docker ps or connecting to disk space, I can troubleshoot common errors, such as connecting to folders in Linux environments.
* Insomnia â€“ I enjoy using Insomnia to test endpoints, but I prefer the older versions, as the recent UI changes donâ€™t fit my workflow as well.
* Linux â€“ I use Linux regularly (primarily Debian and Ubuntu), though my experience is at a basic level. I appreciate the speed, simplicity, and power of the terminal in Linux, which has become my preferred environment.
* VS Code â€“ I am proficient with VS Code, including a variety of plugins. I use it for debugging, compiling, connecting to virtual machines, and setting up the necessary environments for development.
* Windows â€“ I use Windows as my personal operating system, so I am very comfortable with it.
* Additional Software â€“ I am proficient with various programs, including Visual Studio (in addition to VS Code), Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, QGIS, ArcGIS, and many more.
* Virtual Machines â€“ Iâ€™m familiar with working in virtual machines and connecting to cloud environments, especially within unified platforms.
Iâ€™m familiar with Artificial Intelligence and occasionally use it to assist with work tasks, like checking parts of my codeâ€”never private or sensitive data. AI has become incredibly popular, and I understand why. However, Iâ€™m cautious and never fully trust AI-generated code without review and adjustment. While AI can generate valuable ideas, I rarely use its code verbatim; instead, I often refine and adapt helpful snippets. I know that if I use AI-generated code, I am fully responsible for it, so I always make sure I understand the code and carefully check it for security. In my experience, AI can generate working solutions but may include vulnerabilities, so caution is essential.

And yesâ€”all of this text was written with the help of AI! Just to clarify, I wrote this in English, so thereâ€™s no AI translation here. ðŸ˜Š
